# required-things-ubuntu-efx
Bash based program "required-things-ubuntu-efx " contains all the basic programs need to be installed once after installing the new Linux operating system. It saves time unfortunately requires lots of internet data.

Execute it as we execute a normal bash based aplication.

cd required-things-ubuntu-efx.sh

bash required-things-ubuntu-efx.sh
